# UnityMachineLearning_Catcher
Smaller project using reinforcement learning in the Unity3D engine to teach an agent how to catch a falling object</br>
The project does not contain code or any model files from traning sessions in tensorflow, but simply the latest build</br>
given from Unity. The program is windows native as of writing and I might make builds for MAC OSX or linux if requested.</br>
To run the program and see the agent in action, simply run the .exe file inside /MachineLearningGame subfolder.

# TODO:
1. Upload full project folder with source code
2. Make a full tutorial to achieve the same results and walkthrough the unity ML-interface
3. Increase complexity of the environment(Add more falling objects, add more agents, change the rules and actions?)
